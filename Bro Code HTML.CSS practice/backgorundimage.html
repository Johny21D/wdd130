    <h1>My Queen</h1>
    <p>She is my sunrise after the rain,
The gentle calm that ends my pain.
Her laughter fills the empty space,
And paints my soul with heaven’s grace.

When days grow dark, she is my light,
My steady heart through endless night.
Her voice—soft music, sweet and clear,
Turns every silence I hold dear.

She is the dream I live each day,
The reason I find words to say.
No diamond, crown, or star above,
Can shine as bright as her pure love.

The oceans move when she’s near me,
The winds grow soft, the skies set free.
If life should fade, or time should end,
She’s more than lover—she’s my friend.

In every breath, in every swirl,
I live for her—
She is my world. 🌹</p>
